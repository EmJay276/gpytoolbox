# gpytoolbox

This repo is a work in progress and contains general utility functions I have needed to code while trying to work on geometry process research in python.
Most of them will be one-to-one correspondences with [gptoolbox](https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox) functions that I have used in my previous Matlab life
and for which I have found no equivalence in existing libraries. Feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request!

## To Do

- Clean up imports
- Implement 3D version of `linear_elasticity_stiffness.py`
- Implement 3D version of `linear_elasticity.py`
- Implement 3D version of `regular_square_mesh.py`
- Implement 3D version of `fd_grad.py`
- Implement 3D version of `fd_interpolate.py`
- Implement 3D version of `fd_partial_derivative.py`
- Write clear screened vs un-screened PSR test
